# Basic data exploration with pandas on bikeshare data
A python project using pandas to explore bikeshare data.

# Bikeshare project overview

This project focuses on pandas library usage and a simple statistics methods to perform descriptive analysis on the bikeshare data from three major US cities; Chicago, Washington and New York City - to display statistics information such as most popular days, most common stations and duration of the trip.

### Ho to run the program

Input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal to run this program. The project used Anaconda's command prompt.

### Program Details

•	The user specifies and input for city (chicago, new york city, washington).

•	Then the user input the month and day of the week.

•	Then displays the most common month, day and common start hour.

•	Displays statistics on the most popular stations and trip.

•	Display most commonly used start and end station.

•	Display most frequent combination of start station and end station trip.

•	Displays statistics on the total and average trip duration.

•	Displays statistics on bikeshare users.

•	Display counts of user types.

•	Display counts of gender.

•	Display earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth.

•	Display total and mean travel time.

•	Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.

# Application requirements
